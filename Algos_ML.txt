Linear Regression



# Import the linear regression class
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
# Sklearn also has a helper that makes it easy to do cross validation
from sklearn.cross_validation import KFold

# The columns we'll use to predict the target
predictors = ["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Fare", "Embarked"]

# Initialize our algorithm class
alg = LinearRegression()
# Generate cross validation folds for the titanic dataset.  It return the row indices corresponding to train and test.
# We set random_state to ensure we get the same splits every time we run this.
kf = KFold(titanic.shape[1], n_folds=3, random_state=1)

predictions = []
for train, test in kf:
    # The predictors we're using the train the algorithm.  Note how we only take the rows in the train folds.
    train_predictors = (titanic[predictors].iloc[train,:])
    # The target we're using to train the algorithm.
    train_target = titanic["Survived"].iloc[train]
    # Training the algorithm using the predictors and target.
    alg.fit(train_predictors, train_target)
    # We can now make predictions on the test fold
    test_predictions = alg.predict(titanic[predictors].iloc[test,:])
    predictions.append(test_predictions)



Logistic regression


from sklearn import cross_validation

# Initialize our algorithm
alg = LogisticRegression(random_state=1)
# Compute the accuracy score for all the cross validation folds.  (much simpler than what we did before!)
scores = cross_validation.cross_val_score(alg, titanic[predictors], titanic["Survived"], cv=2)
# Take the mean of the scores (because we have one for each fold)
print(scores.mean())


Random Forest


from sklearn import cross_validation
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.cross_validation import KFold

predictors = ["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Fare", "Embarked"]
kf=cross_validation.KFold(titanic.shape[0],n_folds=3,random_state=1)

# Initialize our algorithm with the default paramters
# n_estimators is the number of trees we want to make
# min_samples_split is the minimum number of rows we need to make a split
# min_samples_leaf is the minimum number of samples we can have at the place where a tree branch ends (the bottom points of the tree)
alg = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, n_estimators=10, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1)
scores=cross_validation.cross_val_score(alg,titanic[predictors],titanic["Survived"],cv=kf)
print(scores.mean())



Improve Accuracy in Random Forest(Parameter Tuning)

alg = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, n_estimators=50, min_samples_split=4, min_samples_leaf=2)
scores=cross_validation.cross_val_score(alg,titanic[predictors],titanic["Survived"],cv=kf)
print(scores.mean())

Generating New Features

We can also generate new features. Here are some ideas:

The length of the name -- this could pertain to how rich the person was, and therefore their position in the Titanic.
The total number of people in a family (SibSp + Parch).
An easy way to generate features is to use the .apply method on pandas dataframes. This applies a function you pass in to each element in a dataframe or series. We can pass in a lambda function, which enables us to define a function inline.

To write a lambda function, you write lambda x: len(x). x will take on the value of the input that is passed in -- in this case, the passenger name. The function to the right of the colon is then applied to x, and the result returned. The .apply method takes all of these outputs and constructs a pandas series from them. We can assign this series to a dataframe column.

# Generating a familysize column
titanic["FamilySize"] = titanic["SibSp"] + titanic["Parch"]

# The .apply method generates a new series
titanic["NameLength"] = titanic["Name"].apply(lambda x: len(x))


Using The Title

We can extract the title of the passenger from their name. The titles take the form of Master., Mr., Mrs.. There are a few very commonly used titles, and a "long tail" of one-off titles that only one or two passengers have.

We'll first extract the titles with a regular expression, and then map each unique title to an integer value.

We'll then have a numeric column that corresponds to the appropriate Title.


import re

# A function to get the title from a name.
def get_title(name):
    # Use a regular expression to search for a title.  Titles always consist of capital and lowercase letters, and end with a period.
    title_search = re.search(' ([A-Za-z]+)\.', name)
    # If the title exists, extract and return it.
    if title_search:
        return title_search.group(1)
    return ""

# Get all the titles and print how often each one occurs.
titles = titanic["Name"].apply(get_title)
print(pandas.value_counts(titles))

# Map each title to an integer.  Some titles are very rare, and are compressed into the same codes as other titles.
title_mapping = {"Mr": 1, "Miss": 2, "Mrs": 3, "Master": 4, "Dr": 5, "Rev": 6, "Major": 7, "Col": 7, "Mlle": 8, "Mme": 8, "Don": 9, "Lady": 10, "Countess": 10, "Jonkheer": 10, "Sir": 9, "Capt": 7, "Ms": 2}
for k,v in title_mapping.items():
    titles[titles == k] = v

# Verify that we converted everything.
print(pandas.value_counts(titles))

# Add in the title column.
titanic["Title"] = titles


Family Groups

We can also generate a feature indicating which family people are in. Because survival was likely highly dependent on your family and the people around you, this has a good chance at being a good feature.

To get this, we'll concatenate someone's last name with FamilySize to get a unique family id. We'll then be able to assign a code to each person based on their family id.

import operator

# A dictionary mapping family name to id
family_id_mapping = {}

# A function to get the id given a row
def get_family_id(row):
    # Find the last name by splitting on a comma
    last_name = row["Name"].split(",")[0]
    # Create the family id
    family_id = "{0}{1}".format(last_name, row["FamilySize"])
    # Look up the id in the mapping
    if family_id not in family_id_mapping:
        if len(family_id_mapping) == 0:
            current_id = 1
        else:
            # Get the maximum id from the mapping and add one to it if we don't have an id
            current_id = (max(family_id_mapping.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))[1] + 1)
        family_id_mapping[family_id] = current_id
    return family_id_mapping[family_id]

# Get the family ids with the apply method
family_ids = titanic.apply(get_family_id, axis=1)

# There are a lot of family ids, so we'll compress all of the families under 3 members into one code.
family_ids[titanic["FamilySize"] < 3] = -1

# Print the count of each unique id.
print(pandas.value_counts(family_ids))

titanic["FamilyId"] = family_ids


Finding The Best Features
Feature engineering is the most important part of any machine learning task, and there are lots more features we could calculate. But we also need a way to figure out which features are the best.

One way to do this is to use univariate feature selection. This essentially goes column by column, and figures out which columns correlate most closely with what we're trying to predict (Survived).

As usual, sklearn has a function that will help us with feature selection, SelectKBest. This selects the best features from the data, and allows us to specify how many it selects.


import numpy as np

from sklearn import cross_validation
from sklearn.cross_validation import KFold
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif

predictors = ["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Fare", "Embarked", "FamilySize", "Title", "FamilyId"]

# Perform feature selection
selector = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=5)
selector.fit(titanic[predictors], titanic["Survived"])

# Get the raw p-values for each feature, and transform from p-values into scores
scores = -np.log10(selector.pvalues_)

# Plot the scores.  See how "Pclass", "Sex", "Title", and "Fare" are the best?
plt.bar(range(len(predictors)), scores)
plt.xticks(range(len(predictors)), predictors, rotation='vertical')
plt.show()

# Pick only the four best features.
predictors = ["Pclass", "Sex", "Fare", "Title"]
kf=cross_validation.KFold(titanic.shape[0],n_folds=3,random_state=1)
alg = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, n_estimators=50, min_samples_split=8, min_samples_leaf=4)
scores=cross_validation.cross_val_score(alg,titanic[predictors],titanic["Survived"],cv=kf)
print(scores.mean())


Gradient Boosting

Another method that builds on decision trees is a gradient boosting classifier. Boosting involves training decision trees one after another, and feeding the errors from one tree into the next tree. So each tree is building on all the other trees that came before it. This can lead to overfitting if we build too many trees, though. As you get above 100 trees or so, it's very easy to overfit and train to quirks in the dataset. As our dataset is extremely small, we'll limit the tree count to just 25.

Another way to limit overfitting is to limit the depth to which each tree in the gradient boosting process can be built. We'll limit the tree depth to 3 to avoid overfitting.

from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
import numpy as np

# The algorithms we want to ensemble.
# We're using the more linear predictors for the logistic regression, and everything with the gradient boosting classifier.
algorithms = [
    [GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=1, n_estimators=25, max_depth=3), ["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "Fare", "Embarked", "FamilySize", "Title", "FamilyId"]],
    [LogisticRegression(random_state=1), ["Pclass", "Sex", "Fare", "FamilySize", "Title", "Age", "Embarked"]]
]

# Initialize the cross validation folds
kf = KFold(titanic.shape[0], n_folds=3, random_state=1)

predictions = []
for train, test in kf:
    train_target = titanic["Survived"].iloc[train]
    full_test_predictions = []
    # Make predictions for each algorithm on each fold
    for alg, predictors in algorithms:
        # Fit the algorithm on the training data.
        alg.fit(titanic[predictors].iloc[train,:], train_target)
        # Select and predict on the test fold.  
        # The .astype(float) is necessary to convert the dataframe to all floats and avoid an sklearn error.
        test_predictions = alg.predict_proba(titanic[predictors].iloc[test,:].astype(float))[:,1]
        full_test_predictions.append(test_predictions)
    # Use a simple ensembling scheme -- just average the predictions to get the final classification.
    test_predictions = (full_test_predictions[0] + full_test_predictions[1]) / 2
    # Any value over .5 is assumed to be a 1 prediction, and below .5 is a 0 prediction.
    test_predictions[test_predictions <= .5] = 0
    test_predictions[test_predictions > .5] = 1
    predictions.append(test_predictions)

# Put all the predictions together into one array.

predictions = np.concatenate(predictions, axis=0)

# Compute accuracy by comparing to the training data.
accuracy = sum(predictions[predictions == titanic["Survived"]]) / len(predictions)
print(accuracy)


Matching Our Changes On The Test Set


There are a lot of things we could do to make this analysis better that we'll talk about at the end, but for now, let's make a submission.

The first step is matching all our training set changes on the test set data, like we did in the last mission. We've read the test set into titanic_test. We'll have to match our changes:

Generate the NameLength column, which is how long the name is.
Generate the FamilySize column, showing how large a family is.
Add in the Title column, keeping the same mapping that we had before.
Add in a FamilyId column, keeping the ids consistent across the train and test sets.

We'll try boosting instead of our random forest approach and see if we can improve our accuracy.



# First, we'll add titles to the test set.
titles = titanic_test["Name"].apply(get_title)
# We're adding the Dona title to the mapping, because it's in the test set, but not the training set
title_mapping = {"Mr": 1, "Miss": 2, "Mrs": 3, "Master": 4, "Dr": 5, "Rev": 6, "Major": 7, "Col": 7, "Mlle": 8, "Mme": 8, "Don": 9, "Lady": 10, "Countess": 10, "Jonkheer": 10, "Sir": 9, "Capt": 7, "Ms": 2, "Dona": 10}
for k,v in title_mapping.items():
    titles[titles == k] = v
titanic_test["Title"] = titles
# Check the counts of each unique title.
print(pandas.value_counts(titanic_test["Title"]))

# Now, we add the family size column.
titanic_test["FamilySize"] = titanic_test["SibSp"] + titanic_test["Parch"]

# Now we can add family ids.
# We'll use the same ids that we did earlier.
print(family_id_mapping)

family_ids = titanic_test.apply(get_family_id, axis=1)
family_ids[titanic_test["FamilySize"] < 3] = -1
titanic_test["FamilyId"] = family_ids
titanic_test["NameLength"]=titanic_test["Name"].apply(lambda x: len(x))




Predicting On The Test Set


We have some better predictions now, so let's create another submission.


predictors = ["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "Fare", "Embarked", "FamilySize", "Title", "FamilyId"]

algorithms = [
    [GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=1, n_estimators=25, max_depth=3), predictors],
    [LogisticRegression(random_state=1), ["Pclass", "Sex", "Fare", "FamilySize", "Title", "Age", "Embarked"]]
]

full_predictions = []
for alg, predictors in algorithms:
    # Fit the algorithm using the full training data.
    alg.fit(titanic[predictors], titanic["Survived"])
    # Predict using the test dataset.  We have to convert all the columns to floats to avoid an error.
    predictions = alg.predict_proba(titanic_test[predictors].astype(float))[:,1]
    full_predictions.append(predictions)

# The gradient boosting classifier generates better predictions, so we weight it higher.
predictions = (full_predictions[0] * 3 + full_predictions[1]) / 4
predictions[predictions <= .5] = 0
predictions[predictions > .5] =   1

submission = pandas.DataFrame({"PassengerId":titanic_test["PassengerId"],
                               "Survived":predictions.astype(int)
})



Final Thoughts

Now, we have a submission! It should get you a score of .799 on the leaderboard. You can generate a submission file with submission.to_csv("kaggle.csv", index=False).

There's still more work you can do in feature engineering:

Try using features related to the cabins.
See if any family size features might help -- do the number of women in a family make the whole family more likely to survive?
Does the national origin of the passenger's name have anything to do with survival?
There's also a lot more we can do on the algorithm side:

Try the random forest classifier in the ensemble.
A support vector machine might work well with this data.
We could try neural networks.
Boosting with a different base classifier might work better.
And with ensembling methods:

Could majority voting be a better ensembling method than averaging probabilities?
This dataset is very easy to overfit on because there isn't a lot of data, so you'll be grinding for small accuracy gains. You could also try a different Kaggle competition with more data and richer features to sink into.

Hope you enjoyed this tutorial, and good luck with the machine learning competitions!
